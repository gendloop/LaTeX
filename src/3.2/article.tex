\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the
    document. A brief introduction about the main subject.
\end{abstract}

Paragraph1: After our abstract we can begin the first paragraph,
then press ``enter'' twice to start the second one.

Paragraph2: This line will start a second paragraph.

Paragraph3: I will start the third paragraph and then add \\
a manual line break which causes this text to start
on a new line but remains part of the same paragraph.
Alternatively, I can use the \verb|\newline|\newline command
to start a new line, which is also part of the same paragraph.
